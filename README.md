A voice virtual desktop assistant for Windows 7/10

JARVIS aims to be unique from other desktop assistants. JARVIS is a voice assistant that will be tested and made sure it works on Win 7/10. JARVIS uses the Google Speech recognition for transcription. For natural language processing, JARVIS uses API.AI by google. 

Rather than using Microsoft UI Automation to perform different functions, I aim to make JARVIS directly carry out actions using APIs such as Win32API.

It is a work-in-progress project.
Feel free to get involved.
